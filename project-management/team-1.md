| P-AUTH-02 | Signup | P0 | Ready | ✅ Approved | RV-0004 PASS (re-review) — `ESC-7-API-SIGNUP` registered; notice → `text-iv-info-muted`. Both RV-0001 findings resolved |
| P-AUTH-03 | Org setup (post-signup) | P0 | Ready | ✅ Approved | RV-0007 PASS (Team-4). Exemplary field discipline (frozen `name` only; usage = intent, not sent). NIT: generic `[ESC-7-API]` marker; hand-rolled radio group |
| P-AUTH-04 | Password reset — request | P1 | Ready | ✅ Approved | RV-0010 PASS (Team-4). Non-disclosure exemplary — uniform "if an account exists" confirmation, no existence leak; info-muted, role=status |
| P-AUTH-05 | Password reset — confirm | P1 | Ready | ✅ Approved | RV-0014 PASS (Team-4). Non-disclosure exemplary (uniform invalid/expired); `?state=` harness PROD-GATED (NODE_ENV) — the right dev-preview pattern; server-authoritative token |
| P-AUTH-06 | 2FA challenge | P2 | Ready | ✅ Approved | RV-0017 PASS (Team-4). Server-authoritative; `?state=` PROD-GATED; TOTP+backup toggle; uniform role=alert error (danger-muted); P-4 inks. NIT: h1 in done state |

Completes the Auth cluster |

Shell `icons.ts`(+`security:Lock`)/nav-model(+Security item) git-verified ADDITIVE. Accessible `role=switch` (no kit Switch → flagged). NIT: comment cites Doc-5C for deactivate (it's Doc-4C §C4) |
| P-ACC-04 | Organization profile | P1 | Ready | ✅ Approved | RV-0036 PASS (Team-4). `update_organization_profile` fields verbatim (Doc-4C §C5: name/address VO/contact_info VO/brand_assets_ref; VOs deferred, not coined); `verification_level` read-only (firewall). `transfer_ownership` EXEMPLARY (§C5:267–279: `can_transfer_ownership` Owner-only + never delegable, `new_owner_user_id` active, `reason_code` succession Arch §5.5, Last Owner Protection, TYPED-confirm not colour-only); frozen Org Roles (Inv #2).

OBS: `max-w-2xl` |
| P-ACC-06 | Members | P1 | Ready | ✅ Approved | RV-0044 PASS (Team-4). `set_membership_status` (active⇄suspended) + `remove_member` (→removed terminal) verbatim (Doc-4C §C6, `can_manage_users`, Doc-2 §5.2); **Last Owner Protection §5.5** — sole Owner Suspend+Remove disabled; frozen Org Roles (Inv #2); semantic-table a11y; presentation-only. OBS: "invited" rows = outstanding invitations, scoped to invite flow (revoke_invitation/P-ACC-07), not this page's contracts |
| P-ACC-07 | Invite member | P1 | Ready | 🟡 In Progress | Building — invite form (frozen `invite_member`: `email`+`role_id` REF→roles+`department` opt, `can_manage_users`) + pending-invites table with `revoke_invitation` (invited→removed); org members only (never vendor invites); QUOTA→Billing link; Doc-4C §C6 |
