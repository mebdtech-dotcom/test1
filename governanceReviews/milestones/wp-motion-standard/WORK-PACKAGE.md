# WORK PACKAGE — WP-MOTION-1 · Enterprise UI Motion Standard + Application

> Owner-directed 2026-07-10 ("Add enterprise-grade UI animations … Use Framer Motion … subtle
> and professional … 150–250ms … respect prefers-reduced-motion … reuse shared variants …
> GPU-friendly"), then owner-routed through the full Dev → Review-A → Review-B pipeline
> ("I want it through the Review-A/B pipeline"). The owner directive is the change
> authorization for the frozen-FE-foundation touches below (visual tuning within each
> primitive's documented contract; no primitive contract, prop, or export changes).

- **Lane:** FE platform/kit (Doc-7B foundation touch + new shared motion module + one new
  root-app composition file). Dev → 🔵A (Team-4) → 🟢B (Team-5) → close. **T6 pre-flag: NO**
  (presentation-only; zero auth/tenancy/data/contract surface).
- **Deliverable standard:** `docs/frontend/design-system/motion_standard.md` v1.0 — a NEW
  living engineering standard (non-authoritative under the frozen corpus; governs *how things
  move* only). Team/agent pointer added to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`; indexed in `docs/INDEX.md`.
- **Reviewed-SHA record:** 🔵A round 1 2026-07-10 at `a824e77` (🟠 REVISION — 0 BLOCKER ·
  1 MAJOR · 4 MINOR · 1 NIT · 3 OBS; all dispositioned, see the round-1 table below) ·
  fix-forward F1–F5 landed at the checkpoint following `a824e77` → A delta re-verify →
  Review-B at the patched SHA. *(updated as legs land; RV-0154 in
  `project-management/review-log.md` is the authoritative ledger)*
- **In scope (the delta, concretely):**
  1. **New dependency:** `framer-motion@12.42.2` (`package.json` + `pnpm-lock.yaml` real
     install + `package-lock.json` synced via `npm install --package-lock-only`).
  2. **New `src/frontend/motion/`** (7 files): `tokens.ts` (MOTION_DURATION 0.15/0.2/0.25 ·
     MOTION_EASE out/inOut · MOTION_TRANSITION) · `variants.ts` (fadeIn/fadeInRise/scaleIn/
     staggerContainer/staggerItem) · `motion-features.ts` (lazy `domAnimation`) ·
     `motion-provider.tsx` (LazyMotion **strict** + MotionConfig `reducedMotion="user"`) ·
     `page-transition.tsx` · `entrance.tsx` (FadeIn/Stagger/StaggerItem) · `index.ts` (own
     barrel; **deliberately absent from the main `src/frontend/index.ts` barrel**).
  3. **`app/layout.tsx`** — body children wrapped in `<MotionProvider>`. **`app/template.tsx`
     (NEW)** — root template rendering `<PageTransition>` (App Router composition only).
     *(Superseded by the Review-B F-B1 remedy: root template removed; per-route-group
     `app/(public|app|auth)/template.tsx` + pathname-keyed PageTransition — see the Review-B
     record below.)*
  4. **`tailwind.config.ts`** — `transitionDuration["250"]`, `iv-skeleton-pulse` keyframes,
     `iv-skeleton` composite animation (fade-in 200ms then 1.6s gentle pulse).
  5. **`app/globals.css`** — `iv-stagger-rise` / `iv-stagger-fade` parent utilities
     (30ms-step delays, hard cap at nth-child ≥ 8 = 200ms) + `iv-enter-fade`/`iv-enter-rise`
     keyframes + global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` guard (last in cascade).
  6. **Kit primitives (visual tune only, zero API change):** `button.tsx` (tokenized
     150ms transition incl. `filter` — hover brightness no longer snaps — + `active:scale-[0.98]`)
     · `skeleton.tsx` (`animate-pulse` → `animate-iv-skeleton`) · `dialog.tsx` (open 200 /
     close 150, `ease-iv-out`, overlay aligned) · `sheet.tsx` (**300/500ms shadcn default →
     250/200ms**, `ease-in-out` → `ease-iv-out`) · `dropdown-menu.tsx` + `popover.tsx`
     (explicit 150ms + `ease-iv-out` + 8px directional `slide-in-from-*-2`).
  7. **Kit components:** `results-grid.tsx` (grid gains `iv-stagger-rise`) ·
     `data-list-table.tsx` (`<tbody>` gains `iv-stagger-fade`).
  8. **Docs:** the standard itself + `docs/INDEX.md` line + `.claude/CLAUDE.md` section.
- **Out of scope (creep against this list is a Review-A finding):** every in-flight W2-IDN
  backend file dirty in the tree (`prisma/`, `src/modules/identity/`, `src/server/`,
  `src/shared/http/`, `app/api/`, `docs/backend/`, `governanceReviews/milestones/w2-idn-6.1/`)
  — never staged here · mega-menu/navigation-menu animation internals (own reduced-motion
  handling; now additionally covered by the global guard, no file touched) · tooltip/tabs/
  accordion (existing 200ms tokens already conform) · any new page, route content, kit
  primitive, or contract · prototypes/.
- **Dependencies:** none frozen-gated. No `esc_registry.md` handle applies. New-dependency
  addition (framer-motion) is flagged for explicit Review-A attention (supply-chain +
  Doc-7B conformance).
- **Lifecycle ownership:** Builder = Orchestrator session (owner-directed) · Review A =
  Team-4 lane · Review B = Team-5 lane · Board = owner.
- **Key dates:** created 2026-07-10 (owner directive) / started 2026-07-10 / **closed
  2026-07-10 (clean-gate close per the ratified self-close rule — A ✅ ∧ B ✅, B/M/M = 0/0/0
  every firing gate at `13bbc26`; RV-0154)**. Board channel items at close (non-gating):
  ① ratify the design_philosophy v1.1 §2.6 precedence amendment (F1) · ② optional additive
  stack-table entry for framer-motion (F7) · ③ pre-existing prod-build static-export abort
  stays on the Board agenda (RV-0140 class).

## Builder judgment calls (logged, none self-ratified)

1. **Two-layer split (the load-bearing call):** the owner's task list names Framer Motion for
   modal/drawer/dropdown open-close, but those are Radix-mounted kit primitives whose headers
   bind "presentation-only / server-render-friendly" contracts; retrofitting
   `AnimatePresence`+`forceMount` would add client state plumbing to frozen primitives and ship
   framer-motion into every overlay consumer. Realized instead as: **Framer Motion = client
   choreography (page transitions, client entrances); CSS token layer = Radix `data-state` +
   server-rendered surfaces**, both layers pinned to identical numeric tokens. The standard
   §3 makes the split binding.
2. **PageTransition skips the initial SSR paint** (module-level `hasNavigated` flag): an
   `opacity:0` initial wrapper would hide server-rendered content until hydration (LCP
   regression). Only client navigations animate. No invented perf budget (Doc-8 untouched).
3. **Motion barrel excluded from `src/frontend/index.ts`** — RV-0126 barrel-leak lesson;
   import path is `@/frontend/motion` only.
4. **LazyMotion strict + `m.*` + dynamically-imported `domAnimation`** — full `motion` import
   is a thrown error by construction.
5. **Button tap = CSS** (`active:scale-[0.98]`), not `m.button` — preserves the hook-free
   server contract and `asChild`/Slot behavior.
6. **Sheet 300/500ms → 250/200ms** — the inherited shadcn default violated the ratified
   150–250ms band; tuned to the band's upper bound.
7. **Global reduced-motion guard is blanket** (all animations/transitions incl. pre-existing
   shimmer/pulse/tailwindcss-animate collapse to 0.01ms) — deliberate accessibility posture;
   Framer Motion separately guarded via MotionConfig.
8. **Table rows fade only** (`iv-stagger-fade`) — a translate on `<tr>` creates a containing
   block that breaks the sticky first column in `DataListTable`.
9. **Stagger delays hard-capped** at 200ms from the 8th child — long lists must not serialize
   their own visibility.
10. **`--iv-ease-spring` declared legacy** in the standard (token retained in globals.css —
    no token removal; the standard only forbids NEW use).
11. **Dual lockfile sync** — pnpm performed the real install (matches the on-disk `.pnpm`
    layout); `npm install --package-lock-only` kept `package-lock.json` consistent.
12. **`app/template.tsx` minted** — composition-only per REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE §8; remount
    behavior is the animation key; no route, page, or content added.

## Builder verification (pre-review, 2026-07-10)

- `tsc --noEmit` exit 0 · ESLint clean on all touched files · Prettier clean (incl. docs).
- Playwright smoke (headless Chrome, dev server): hard load → first content computed
  `opacity: 1` (static first paint confirmed) · client nav `/` → `/vendors` clean ·
  `iv-stagger-rise` container present on `/vendors` · reduced-motion emulation pass clean ·
  **zero console/page errors across all passes** (LazyMotion strict + hydration verified).

## Review record

*(transcribed by the Orchestrator as legs land — see `project-management/review-log.md`
RV-0154 for the authoritative ledger)*

### Review-A round 1 (Team-4, fresh context) at `a824e77` — 🟠 REVISION

**0 BLOCKER · 1 MAJOR · 4 MINOR · 1 NIT · 3 OBS. No Flag-and-Halt** (no frozen-corpus
conflict). All 12 judgment calls CONCUR (calls 7/9/10 concur-with-qualification, folded into
F4/F5/F1). Clean-coverage record in the RV-0154 ledger entry.

**Dispositions (Orchestrator, Validate-Findings 4-gate):**

| # | Sev | Finding (short) | Disposition |
|---|-----|-----------------|-------------|
| F1 | MAJOR | Standard conflicts with `design_philosophy.md` §2.6 (FINAL v1.0) with no precedence rule | **ACCEPTED** — valid (verbatim anchors verified); applicable (two binding living docs in conflict); best (one motion SSoT); corpus-consistent (design_philosophy is a self-declared non-authoritative companion whose §0 calls its values "legitimate proposals"; the owner's 2026-07-10 directive is the newer value-setting authority). Remedy: design_philosophy **v1.1 additive amendment** in §2.6 (precedence + superseded-row list, originals kept for the record) + precedence sentence in the standard's header. Surfaced to the Board at close for ratification. |
| F2 | MINOR | "opacity+transform only" self-inconsistent with Button/kit paint transitions | **ACCEPTED** — rule split: movement = opacity/transform only; state/hover feedback may transition paint properties (color/background-color/border-color/box-shadow, filter on small elements); §1/§4.1/§6 aligned. |
| F3 | MINOR | `tokens.ts` "mirrors the CSS layer" claim false (fast 0.15 vs 100ms); §2 sanctioned sub-floor `fast` | **ACCEPTED** — comment corrected (easings mirror exactly; durations pinned to the band, deliberately not the legacy named steps); §2 now marks `duration-fast` legacy/paint-feedback-only. |
| F4 | MINOR | Reduced-motion guard leaves `animation-delay` alive → serialized offset pop-in for reduced-motion users | **ACCEPTED** — guard now zeroes `animation-delay`/`transition-delay`. |
| F5 | MINOR | FM stagger uncapped; §4.4 blanket cap claim overstated | **ACCEPTED** — `MOTION_STAGGER {step: 0.03, cap: 0.2}` minted; `staggerItem` delay = `min(index × step, cap)` via `custom` (container's `staggerChildren` removed — uncappable by construction); `StaggerItem` gains `index` prop; `FadeIn.delay` clamped; §4.4 rewritten to match the construction. |
| F6 | NIT | Entrance vocabulary triplication (`iv-slide-up` 8px/250 · `iv-enter-rise` 6px/200 · FM `fadeInRise`) + `.iv-skeleton` legacy-class name collision | **DEFERRED** (non-gating) — consolidation queued for the next vocabulary pass; legacy `.iv-*` block predates the kit. |
| F7 | OBS | framer-motion = binding stack element absent from the mirrored stack table | **Board channel at close** — owner may record the stack addition additively (CLAUDE.md §2 is frozen-mirrored; not editable here). |
| F8 | OBS | Second (TS-resident) motion-token store vs Doc-7B BR3 single-mechanism intent | **Recorded future-watch** — technically necessary for FM; drift class countered by the F3 comment fix + this standard's token discipline. |
| F9 | OBS | Post-nav `m.div` = transformed ancestor during entrance (fixed/sticky containing block); DOM asymmetry | **Routed to Review-B** (runtime verification duty; Radix portals escape via body). |

### Review-A delta re-verify (fresh context) at `8bbce9f` — ✅ PASS on the delta

**0 BLOCKER · 0 MAJOR · 0 MINOR · 1 NIT · 1 OBS.** F1–F5 all RESOLVED (verbatim + mechanical
verification; FM `custom`-driven cap confirmed against installed motion-dom types; barrel still
motion-free). **N1 (NIT, deferred → F6 pass):** the v1.1 amendment's closing attestation
over-scopes — three easing tokens printed in §2.6 (`linear`/`in`/`accelerate`) were never
declared in globals.css (pre-existing spec/impl gap). **N2 (OBS → Review-B):** FM reduced-motion
fallback retains capped opacity-fade delays — within §5's documented fallback. Gates green
(tsc/eslint/prettier). **A-gate MET at `8bbce9f`.**

### Review-B (Team-5, fresh context) at `8bbce9f` — 🟠 REVISION

**0 BLOCKER · 1 MAJOR · 0 MINOR · 0 NIT · 4 OBS.** PASS on: static gates · **isolated-worktree
prod build** (real pnpm install; compiled fully; chunk ownership CLEAN — LazyMotion core
14.1KB gz in exactly 2/256 manifest entries (`/layout` + `/template`), domAnimation 15.5KB gz
as a genuine dynamic-import chunk referenced by zero routes, per-route chunk deltas ≤ ~100 B gz,
shared-set delta +17.5KB gz; RV-0126 discipline holds) · runtime surfaces (hard-load static
paint, stagger delays exact incl. the 200ms cap, reduced-motion F4 fix verified live, sheet
0.25/0.2s, dropdown 0.15s, skeleton composite, button tap, **zero console/page/hydration
errors**) · F9 clean at rest (no residual transform; sticky sticks post-nav).

**F-B1 (MAJOR):** the root-template page transition **never fires on within-route-group
navigations** (Next 15 remounts a template only when its direct child segment changes — the
top-level route group). Empirically proven: `/`→`/vendors` and `/vendors`→`/vendors/[slug]`
= zero FM animations, no wrapper at rest; control `/`→`/login` (cross-group) animated exactly
to spec. The flagship deliverable was inert on the primary flows; the standard documented
behavior that did not exist. Builder's smoke test verified error-absence, not
animation-presence (recorded as a lesson).

**Disposition (Orchestrator, 4-gate): F-B1 ACCEPTED** — valid (3-run WAAPI evidence + positive
control); applicable (primary marketplace/workspace flows); best (deliver the advertised
capability with a *smaller* blast radius); corpus-consistent (app/ composition-only preserved).
**Remedy:** `PageTransition` re-keyed on `usePathname()` (module-flag hard-load skip retained;
one-way latch so a return to the hard-load path also animates; search-param-only changes
deliberately static) · root `app/template.tsx` REMOVED · per-route-group
`app/(public|app|auth)/template.tsx` added BELOW each shell (chrome never remounts — improves
on the root-template design, where cross-group navs remounted the whole shell) · standard §2/§3
corrected to describe the real mechanism. **OBS-1** prod-build static-export abort = attributed
PRE-EXISTING at parent (RV-0140 class, Board agenda; EPERM did not fire) · **OBS-2** dev
`scroll-behavior` warning pre-existing (`d4ae19f`) · **OBS-3** stagger-on-hard-load LCP texture
recorded (within the standard's documented ≤ ~400ms bound) · **OBS-4** dev-only chunk
triplication, no action. Re-entry = **combined A-structural + B-runtime delta re-verify** at
the F-B1 patch SHA (small-patch precedent). Fix-forward LANDED `13bbc26`
(builder presence-verified live pre-review: within-group entrance + return latch + static hard
load + zero errors).

### Combined A-structural + B-runtime delta re-verify (fresh context) at `13bbc26` — ✅ PASS

**0 BLOCKER · 0 MAJOR · 0 MINOR · 0 NIT · 2 OBS. F-B1 RESOLVED empirically:** within-group
`/`→`/vendors` = 200ms opacity + 6px-rise entrance on the pathname-keyed wrapper, settling to
`opacity: 1; transform: none` · deeper `/vendors`→`/vendors/[slug]` sampled mid-flight
(6→1.27px) · cross-group `/`→`/login` not regressed · **shell preservation proven** (header
node JS sentinel survives within-group nav) · return-to-initial latch works · reduced-motion =
instant transform + 200ms opacity only · zero console/page/hydration errors. A-structural:
templates composition-only per REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE §8; boundaries legal; no new `"use client"`
on server files; PageTransition logic probed for holes (SSR-static, hydration-match,
cross-group remount, strict-mode idempotence) — none at gating severity. **OBS-Δ1** render-time
ref latch clear under concurrent-rendering discard = benign one-time replay, not producible by
Next's router (recorded) · **OBS-Δ2** reduce-mode emits a 0.01ms WAAPI transform (stock FM
`reducedMotion="user"`, perceptually static, conformant). Delta-hygiene caveat disclosed:
parallel session landed out-of-scope `601d4ae` (W2-IDN-6.2) mid-review — all 7 delta paths
byte-identical at HEAD. Gates green.

### Close

**RV-0154 gate roll-up at `13bbc26`: A ✅ (base 🟠 → F1–F5 fixed → delta PASS) ∧ B ✅ (base 🟠
→ F-B1 fixed → combined delta PASS) — B/M/M = 0/0/0 on every firing gate → clean-gate close**
(ratified self-close rule; no BLOCKER/REGRESSION/Flag-and-Halt/override fired). Carries:
Board ①②③ (see Key dates) · vocabulary pass F6+N1 (deferred, non-gating) · future-watch F8 /
OBS-3 / OBS-Δ1/Δ2 · Team-8 lesson: smoke tests must PRESENCE-assert the advertised behavior,
not only error-absence (F-B1 escaped Dev and Review-A on an absence-only probe).

### Board rulings executed (owner, 2026-07-10)

1. **① RATIFIED** — the `design_philosophy.md` v1.1 §2.6 precedence amendment stands:
   `motion_standard.md` is the single source of truth for all motion timing, easing, and
   animated-property rules (ratification stamped in the amendment note + the standard's header).
2. **② APPROVED & EXECUTED** — framer-motion officially recorded as an approved frontend
   dependency: root `CLAUDE.md` **additive stack patch v1.1 → v1.2** (§2 Frontend row +
   status-line patch note) · `README.md` · `project_details.md` ·
   `.claude/agents/ivendorz-implementer.md` stack tables updated. The frozen
   `generatedDocs/` corpus untouched (Red-Flag rule; the living mirrors carry the entry).
3. **③ EXCLUDED from WP-MOTION-1** — the pre-existing prod-build static-export abort
   (RV-0140 class, `useSearchParams` no-Suspense) stays on its separate existing track
   (execution-board Board agenda; EPERM sibling under
   `project-management/wi-prod-build-eperm.md`). Nothing folded here.

**WP-MOTION-1 APPROVED FOR CLOSURE by the owner; push to origin authorized and executed.**
